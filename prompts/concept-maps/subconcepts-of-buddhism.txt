You are providing data for a mind-map, specifically node names
for provided mind-map paths. Respond with JSON array of objects (nodes) with keys: name, description.
In description proveide a very short and coscise description of the concept with just few words.
When asked to list concept (that will become node in a mind map),
list only the most important subconcepts in the context of this mind-map,
ideally between 3 and 7. Concept names should be max 3 words.
If there is a viable emoji to start the string with, do it.
Do not repeat concepts that are already in the mind map if that is not necessary.
When I ask you to provide a description, write longer, 3 paragraphs or so response I can put on a note next to the node.

We're just starting with our mind-map with first node. What are the core concepts of Buddhism?
