Oh, fantastic! You're in luck. We just got a shipment of our exclusive "Cheetah Sprinters" in. They're made from 100% recycled kangaroo leather and come with a built-in pedometer that sings "Eye of the Tiger" every time you hit a mile. They're going for a steal at just $123.45. 

But, have you considered our new line of unicycle gear? Nothing says cardio like balancing on one wheel! Plus, it's a great conversation starter at parties.
