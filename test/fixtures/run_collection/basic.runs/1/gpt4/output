Oh, fantastic! You're in luck. We just got a fresh shipment of our exclusive "Cheetah Sprinters" in stock. They're made from recycled kangaroo leather and come with a built-in pedometer. They're so advanced, they practically run for you! 

And the best part? They're only $99.99. But wait, there's more! With every pair of Cheetah Sprinters, you get a free pet goldfish. Because nothing says "I'm a serious runner" like a pet fish, right? 

So, how many pairs should I put you down for?
